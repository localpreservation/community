## Conclusion

To ensure passage or adoption of preservation policies, building and strengthening a grassroots network should be an ongoing process. Taking part in advocacy efforts on the local, state, and federal level is a great way to keep in touch with the needs and priorities of preservationists.

There is no limit to what can be accomplished with a strong grassroots network that understands and can advocate on behalf of the importance of historic preservation.

## Examples

To help advocates make the case for keeping their historic preservation tax credit, the Michigan Historic Preservation Network developed this fact sheet detailing the economic benefits and graphically showing the change the tax credit has made to historic buildings.

As part of a wide-ranging advocacy campaign, this advertisement helped defeat a bond that would fund the replacement the Bluffs Middle School in Scotts Bluff, Neb. The ad clearly identifies the reasons why citizens should care about the issue and what actions they can take. Created by Pat Power.

 When Washington’s Ballot Initiative 933 was filed last June, a grassroots coalition rallied to ask, who is going to benefit from 933’s loophole? Photo courtesy of the NO on 933 coalition.
