## Conclusion

To ensure passage or adoption of preservation policies, building and strengthening a grassroots network should be an ongoing process. Taking part in advocacy efforts on the local, state, and federal level is a great way to keep in touch with the needs and priorities of preservationists. There is no limit to what can be accomplished with a strong grassroots network that understands and can advocate on behalf of the importance of historic preservation.

## Examples

As part of a wide-ranging advocacy campaign, this advertisement helped defeat a bond that would fund the replacement the Bluffs Middle School in Scotts Bluff, Neb. The ad clearly identifies the reasons why citizens should care about the issue and what actions they can take. Created by Pat Power.
