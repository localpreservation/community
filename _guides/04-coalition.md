Working with a coalition of advocates can greatly increase the chance of getting a preservation policy adopted or passed by a governmental body. Coalitions can also have a positive impact when organized for defensive reasons (e.g., protecting a historic site or an existing preservation policy). Identifying partners who can be of assistance and working with them in an equitable and responsible manner can increase the coalition’s stature in the eyes of elected officials as well as the public they serve.

## What Is an Advocacy Coalition?

Coalitions formed for advocacy purposes generally consist of individuals, businesses, associations, and nonprofit groups. Representatives of government agencies can also participate by providing data or information that can be used by the coalitions. Many times coalitions are formed to address a single policy issue, although in some instances, coalitions seek to address a range of issues and develop a joint policy agenda. Whether they are permanent or formed temporarily for a specific purpose, all effective coalitions share a common trait— they are action-oriented and work toward a specific goal.

## Benefits Of Working With a Coalition

Coalitions offer several benefits. The old adage, “many hands make light work,” is true. With additional resources focused on achieving the preservation policy objective, you can now share the burden of planning events, working with the media, and educating the public, officials, and grassroots constituencies. Likewise, costs for activities such as hiring a lobbyist or direct
mail campaigns will be lower for each coalition member than if a single organization had undertaken an advocacy campaign on its own.

In addition to pooling financial and human resources, coalitions also offer the opportunity to increase credibility for your public policy purpose. Coalitions demonstrate a broad base of support to officials, and help create a compelling message that reaches a larger audience.

Examples of successful coalition-driven policy changes include the passage, protection, and amending of state rehabilitation tax credit programs. For example, the Coalition for Neighborhood and Economic Renewal worked to pass and continues to protect the Rhode Island Historic Preservation Tax Credit, first enacted in 2002. The 57-member coalition, led by Grow Smart Rhode Island, includes representatives from the tourism industry, city governments, developers, and Preserve Rhode Island.

Other examples of public policy issues that could benefit from the efforts of a coalition include promoting amendments to a state building code to encourage rehabilitation and influencing school facility policy to change the bias that favors new construction over preservation.
