Successful advocacy coalitions take hard work, but the results are worth the investment of time and energy. One such coalition, the Preservation Coalition of Massachusetts, sought an economic incentive that would benefit historic buildings within the Commonwealth.

In 2003 the coalition conceived, drafted, and successfully lobbied for a state tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic commercial properties. This program, administered by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, has helped renovate theaters in Worcester, hotels in Boston, and new housing stock in Lawrence. Not content to rest on its laurels, the coalition successfully worked with elected officials to raise the program cap from $10 million to $50 million in 2006. By creating a similarly effective coalition, advocates can put in place policies and programs that encourage the preservation of our historic communities.
