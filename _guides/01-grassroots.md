## Developing a Grassroots Network

Engaging in the political process and communicating with elected officials are essential components to successfully promote historic preservation policies. Elected officials want and need to hear from their constituents. As they develop their priorities, they take into consideration opinions of both trusted experts and their supporters. As preservationists, it is our responsibility to communicate directly with decision makers and to help them understand the benefits and value of historic preservation.

## What Is Grassroots Advocacy?

Grassroots advocacy is collective citizen action to influence decision makers. Its goal is to activate a broad group of people to take action on an issue and to give those people the tools to communicate to their elected officials effectively. This “bottom-up approach” allows the voice of average Americans to be taken into account in the political process.

## Why a Grassroots Network Is Important

Building a grassroots network is a key element to promoting preservation policies. First, there is truth to the saying that there is strength in numbers. If preservation has popular support and is seen as a priority to the general public, then elected officials will be more likely to take it into consideration when acting on policy measures. Having a large number and wide range of supporters lends credibility to the preservation policy for which you are advocating. A strong grassroots network will also help to build the preservation movement by engaging new audiences. People are more likely to become involved in preservation when they are aware that advocating on behalf of a specific issue will have a positive impact on the quality of life in their community. A grassroots network that can be counted on for quick action is also helpful when potential threats arise to historic and cultural resources. Finally, developing a grassroots network empowers people by helping to exercise their voice in the political process.
